# Continuity Ledger — Book 1 (Ch1–8)

## Time & Timers
- Real world: 8h pod → ~7 in-game days (24:1).
- Domain Authority (temp amp): Granted Ch6; clock called out in Ch7 (~18:42 remaining on second descent). Sustained Domain granted on quest completion (Ch8).
- Overreach warnings: Lyra hits near-threshold in Ch4 (serpent) and Ch8 (Nexus surgery, near-loss suture).

## Gear & State
- Kenji
  - Weapon: Leafblade Nodachi (Grovecraft), sap-reinforced in Ch6; synergy with Iron-Oak Iaido.
  - Armor: Bark plates w/ living-plate flex; left side cracked ribs (Ch8, guardian intercept). Calf laceration (Ch5–7 retreat).
  - Skills: Iron-Oak Iaido (forms), Forest-Kata — Bloodline Tempo, Iron Gate — True Parry, Bloodtide Counter (sacrificial), Rootline Riposte (purified ground only).
- Lyra
  - Spells: Verdant Latch, Fire Within → Hearthward (radius sanctuary), Verdant Purge (Stable), Rootspeak (subterranean mapping), Verdant Snare (implied), Antivenom field-synthesis (Ch4).
  - Role: Purifier; tolerance for proximity to corruption; domain holder.

## UI Conventions (in-world)
- Claimant Mark pulses sync with local systems; attention draw; detection radius varies.
- Status messages reflect intent verification (e.g., Bloodtide requires deliberate intercept).

## Injuries / Scars
- Kenji: Shoulder laceration Ch2 (wargkin); serpent bite arm (neutralized, residual trauma); cracked ribs left side Ch8; calf barbed lash (managed).
- Lyra: Overreach strain (Ch4, Ch8) — fatigue/voice raspy post-surgery; note to carry transient hoarseness into immediate postfight.

## Locations & Factions
- Whispering Taiga: Blight static baseline; goes silent after Ch8.
- Verdant Grove: Conditional safe zone in Ch3; conditional→tethered→domain.
- Cave/Nexus: Lobby → trophy gallery (raised druids) → sanctum (Nexus operator Sable).

## Antagonists / Threads
- Sable: Blightweaver operator (UNBOUND), spared in Ch8; stripped of class; unresolved.
- Whale/Citadel party: casualties in cave; surviving witness extracted; corporate retaliation thread.

## Rules — Systemic
- Consent vs Compile: Grove requires offer/request; Blight rewrites.
- Skills read character: parry→riposte posture, intercept→martyr bonus, practice→tempo.
- Organic blade restriction persists; Grovecraft enhances anti-corruption resonance.

## Costs & Effects (quick ref)
- Verdant Purge (Stable): room-scale cleanse; Stamina Moderate; Overreach threshold raised.
- Hearthward: warmth + anti-corruption field; sustained focus Low.
- Rootspeak: requires contact with living/purified soil; maps corruption density/nodes.
- Iron Gate: +18% window; Perfect Redirect (60s CD).
- Bloodline Tempo: +12% next strike (5s).
- Bloodtide Counter: +40% + crit next strike after intentional intercept; full damage taken.
- Rootline Riposte: subsurface cone stagger on purified/domain ground only.

## Foreshadowing Markers Added (Ch5–8)
- Ch5: Lattice pre-signal hiccup before gallery reveal.
- Ch6: Domain timer seeded on grant.
- Ch8: Near-loss suture + sensory beat between network sever and reward UI.
