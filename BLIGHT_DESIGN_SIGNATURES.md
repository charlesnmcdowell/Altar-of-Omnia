# Original Blight Designers — Symbolic Tells to Seed

Use these sparingly as recurring motifs to imply an ancestral author of the corruption network.

1) Tri‑Knot Glyph
- A three‑loop knotwork mark (not Celtic; sharper angles) appearing in: 
  - Overlapping lattice nodes (seen faintly when corruption is thinnest)
  - On the underside of certain bone‑coral plates (maintenance hatch seams)
- Meaning hint: triune recursion — build→test→deploy. The Grove elders misread it as decorative; Purifier recognizes it as a process stamp.

2) Copper–Ozone Scent
- Distinct smell preceding engineered nodes/terminals — metallic (copper) + sharp ozone, like storm air in a machine shop.
- Use as early warning sensory for “designed, not grown” corruption. Becomes stronger near actual consoles.

3) Geometry Stamp: 5–8–13 Spiral
- A spiral proportion that follows 5, 8, 13 segmenting — not natural phyllotaxis; a Fibonacci variant with hard-edged segment boundaries.
- Shows in: venom etch patterns (Ch4), sanctum wall ribs, and on any portable blight‑tool we show later.

Optional Deep Cut for Book 2
- A hidden checksum phrase embedded in lattice pulse timing (short–short–long pattern repeating in 3s bursts), decodable via Rootspeak as an ancient version string.
