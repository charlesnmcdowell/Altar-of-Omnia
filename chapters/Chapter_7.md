# Chapter 7: The Purifier’s Road

The second descent didn’t sound like the first.

Rootspeak put wires under the world.

Lyra could feel the lattice like a board in her mind now — cold lines, bad breath, pressure points where corruption used rootways as routers. She moved a palm along stone and felt echoes of the last twenty-four hours humming like compiled instructions.

“There,” she said, pointing where the corridor’s seam widened by a finger’s breadth. “There’s a back artery. Squeeze.”

The squirrel druid flattened himself like he’d been taught by a lifetime of small bodies. He found the crack, vanished sideways, and hissed them through into a narrow service passage that smelled like stale water and old, wrong light.

Sable breathed from somewhere deeper. The cave rebuilt behind them like a janitor who resented their mess.

Lyra knelt in the first choke point.

“Purge,” she whispered.

Not a flood. A ring.

The wall’s black veins peeled like film pulled off glass. The air got cleaner in a way Kenji felt at his molars. The hum in his head stepped back.

Raised creatures found them within minutes — two deer-wolves with eyes like burned milk and joints that moved like software bugs. They hit the edge of the purified ring and stuttered, momentum screaming one thing while control signals said another. Kenji stepped in and made the argument moot.

They moved ring by ring.

Lyra braced, drew a green circle in the world, and handed Kenji good ground to kill on. He worked the edge of each circle like a threshing floor, parry chaining into Riposte, into Tempo, into another parry. The pattern wasn’t just effective. It was teaching him what he’d been trying to say since he decided eight hours of pain was better than a lifetime of numb.

The system doesn’t care how sharp your sword is. It cares whether you mean it.

The cave noticed.

The walls thickened where they had been thin. The purified rings healed behind them like skin closing over a wound. The air tried to muffle their breath.

Sable’s voice called down an intersecting hall. “You’re drawing circles in my house.”

Lyra didn’t lift her head. “I’m erasing code you vandalized.”

Sable laughed, warm and exhausted. “You call their morality a license. I call mine a compiler. Same arrogance. Mine is just honest about it.”

Three alcoves walked at them.

Raised druids didn’t move like men taken from sleep this time. They moved like weapons. One threw a rotten fog that had once been Fire Within. One grew bone-thorns and fired them like arrows. One called roots that un-grew into whips that peeled skin in ribbons.

Kenji stepped through thorn-fire and let the first volley trace the arc where his face had been a second before. His blade caught a whip and rode it back to the caster, snapping the spell’s arm at the shoulder line. Lyra rolled off her knees and lifted her left hand, palm flat.

“Purge,” she said, smaller and sharper.

The bone-thorn druid froze. The pale lattice under his skin flared and then folded in on itself like a burn that remembered how to be a wound.

He fell to his knees. His eyes went green for one inhale.

“…Tell—”

He collapsed. Lyra held his shoulders and didn’t ask what the word had been. The squirrel druid stepped over them both and set the man’s head on the floor with a care that made Kenji’s throat hurt.

The last druid sent a fog-knuckle rolling at Kenji’s chest like a tide of liquid rot. Kenji cut the edge of it instead of the body — just a nick on the corner — and watched the spell’s geometry fail at the seam.

He smiled. “Got you.”

They entered the sanctum on a green radius that made the lattice on the floor twitch.

The Nexus was a heart. A bad one.

Root, bone, crystal — all of it pulsing with organized wrongness. The repeating lattice was everywhere now, and seeing it in full didn’t make it feel more like nature. It made it feel more like theft.

Sable sat in front of it as if it had called “down” and she’d obeyed out of habit. She looked young and human and very tired. The lattice-light in her eyes made her gaze look like someone had repurposed it for interface.

“You made it,” she said, voice not surprised. “I’m genuinely impressed. The Grove usually chews up the brave and spits out martyrs.”

Kenji didn’t raise the blade. The blade didn’t need raising to be a promise.

“You said you found something better than anger,” Lyra said.

“I found leverage,” Sable said simply. “I found a system that doesn’t pretend to love anything. It just works. It reformats whatever it touches into the language it needs. No druids at the door testing your soul with riddles. No cities taking a cut of your death.”

Lyra didn’t look away. “You didn’t remove gatekeepers. You became one.”

Sable’s mouth flickered — not laughter, not offense. Recognition around the edges. “It’s funny you think I’m at the gate. I’m the lock. The Blight is the door. The forest can’t handle the future. It was built to select. I was built to be selected against. I chose a different selector.”

“You rewrote your dead into lieutenants,” Kenji said. “Consent isn’t a selector.”

Sable flinched like a woman catching herself in a mirror she didn’t know was there. The lattice shimmer behind her retinas stuttered and then reasserted itself like a system deciding it had indulged long enough.

“I can’t stop now,” she said softly. “If I let go, it collapses. Including me.”

“Then we cut you loose,” Lyra said.

Sable’s eyes sharpened. “You can’t.”

Kenji stepped a foot forward onto the ring of cleaned floor like a man stepping onto a name he’d chosen. “Watch her.”

The Nexus woke like a storm does when it decides to be personal.

The chamber extruded bone-coral spikes that turned into teeth. The floor opened into mouths and closed like hands. The walls lunged.

Kenji fought architecture.

Rootline Riposte slammed shockwaves through purified ground that made bone-coral legs stutter. Tempo stacked on Redirect stacked on every kata he’d practiced in a murder den at eighty percent sensitivity. He didn’t dance so much as argue — parry saying “no,” cut saying “now,” feet saying “here.”

They reached the base of the Nexus.

Sable stood without standing, the lattice lifting her a hand’s width off the floor.

“Last chance,” she said, and this time it sounded less like threat and more like a panic she was ashamed of. “If you sever this, there isn’t a me to walk away.”

Lyra set her left hand on the Nexus and her right on Sable’s tether.

“Then we separate what shouldn’t have fused,” she said.

“Lyra,” Kenji said, warning as prayer.

“I know,” she said. She didn’t look away from Sable. “Hold the room.”

The cave became an operating theater with the building trying to kill the surgeon.
