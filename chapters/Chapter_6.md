# Chapter 6: The Weight of the Circle

The Grove felt them coming.

By the time they limped under the living arches with the Citadel man half-draped over Kenji’s good side, the ward’s low hum had tightened into something like attention. Druids stepped out of training rings and healer hollows. Faces lifted. Hopes did what hopes always do around wounded messengers — they strained and steeled in the same breath.

They told the truth.

The names carved into bark-cloth around the empty stone circle became bodies with glassy eyes in Lyra’s mouth. The young druid who had tried to cover Eira’s nameplate put both hands on it as if gripping a throat and bent until his forehead touched stone. He didn’t make a sound. The sound he didn’t make filled the Grove.

The woman with ivy in her hair listened without interrupting. When Lyra finished, she didn’t speak. She walked to the specimen hollow and set her palm on the sap prism with the black-veined leaf inside like a woman touching a headstone because there is nothing better to touch.

Kenji mapped the cave with the survivor using sticks and the Grove’s dirt. He sketched boot prints that ended and scuffs that began. He drew pillars and conduits and corridors that had become knives when Sable breathed on them. He laid marks where raised druids had stepped off their shelves.

“She runs them on the lattice,” he said. “Not their will. If you cut the lattice, they fall. But inside, it’s everywhere.”

Lyra looked up from where she’d been kneeling in the training ring with sap water between her palms, building a braid without overreaching. “Except where it’s been cleaned.”

“Except there,” Kenji said. He tapped the dirt. “You cut corridors. I hold them. We move the line forward.”

“Her lattice will rebuild behind you,” the Grove woman said. “You will be crushed between regrowth and war.”

Lyra’s voice didn’t lift. “Then you strengthen us.”

The debate among the ring was not about whether. It was about how much of themselves they were willing to staple to two strangers.

The Grove woman made a decision that looked like opening a fist. “Domain,” she said.

Half the druids swore in one language or another. The young one by Eira’s stone looked up, red-eyed. “We don’t—”

“We do,” she said. “They carry our oath whether we give it shape or not. We make it binding. Or we wait for the Blight to make their deaths binding for us.”

The ritual was not smoke and chant. It was breath and touch.

[DOMAIN AUTHORITY GRANTED: Verdant Grove]
[Effect: Attunement amplified within Grove territory]
[Effect: Ward network responds to Domain holders]
[Effect: Nature magic costs reduced]
[Warning: Domain holders share the Grove’s fate]

Kenji took the seed-stone without making a joke for once. It warmed in his palm like hand-to-hand contact.

“So we went from tenants to landlords,” he said anyway, quiet returning to his mouth like tide after humor. “With a mortgage that kills us if we default.”

Lyra knelt over the training basin again. The braid rose from sap-water smoother this time, thinner, stronger. The Grove woman watched, said nothing, and then spoke a truth that didn’t soften as it explained.

“You unlocked Purifier in two days,” she said. “I trained twenty years and still fear putting my hands where you just did. The difference is not that you are better. It’s that you will touch what I won’t.”

Lyra’s hands didn’t shake. “Then teach me what to do with what I touch.”

Training compresses when you’ve been in a place long enough that the place decides you’re worth investing in.

Kenji learned to hear the ground.

Forest-kata taught him to move through air; Rootline Riposte taught him to move through earth. On purified soil the Grove’s network turned his parries into counter-pulses that traveled under enemies’ feet and into their balance, popping joints open from below.

[Skill Learned: Rootline Riposte]
Effect: After successful parry on Grove-connected or Purified ground, send a root-shock that staggers or trips enemies in a cone.
Restriction: Requires Purified soil or Grove domain.

His leafblade drank a thin line of Heart-Tree sap and came away with a vein-brightness that tricked his grip into thinking it had always been there.

Lyra learned to cut without burning.

Verdant Purge stopped being a flood and started being a scalpel. She learned to apply it at room scale without killing her own stamina. Rootspeak carved the underground into a live map. Fire Within took a breath and became Hearthward — a steady radius that pushed the lattice back like a boundary spell, a moving sanctuary that made Kenji feel taller when he stood inside it.

[Spell Evolved: Fire Within → Hearthward]
Effect: Ambient warmth + anti-corruption field. Allies inside resist blight influence, corruption re-growth slowed.

The squirrel druid came back human and grave. “I know a back passage she hasn’t fed yet,” he said. “My lads—” he caught that and smiled without humor “—my lads died finding it. I would like them not to have died for nothing.”

Departure felt like a community standing still so two people could move.

The Grove woman held out the last thing they had to give that wasn’t their lives. “If you find them,” she said, meaning the leaders on the cave wall, “free them. Even if it is a freedom that ends them.”

Lyra bowed her head over the seed-stone tied at her wrist. “I will.”

Kenji rolled his shoulders under the bark plates the armorers had taught to move with him. He adjusted the nodachi.

He didn’t say anything.

They stepped out together, and the ward’s hum followed them like a hand at their backs.
