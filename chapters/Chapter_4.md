The frost-line tightened the moment they passed beneath the Grove's living arches.

It just got stingy—thinner, sharper, hugging the ground like it was guiding them with a needle instead of a hand.

Kenji's leaf-and-thorn sigil pulsed on the back of his hand.

Warm.

Then hotter.

Then a dull throb that synced with his heartbeat like the mark had its own metronome.

[Status: CLAIMANT MARK (Grovebound) — Active]

[Effect: Attention Draw — Unknown Radius]

[Anchor: Verdant Grove — Online]

Kenji flexed his fingers. "So we're tethered now."

Lyra didn't slow. Shadow-moss draped her shoulders and drank the light around her, turning her into a moving patch of night. "And detectable."

"Yeah." Kenji adjusted the leafblade nodachi on his shoulder. The weapon rode easy, like it had always belonged there. "Feels like the system stapled a 'Please Harass' sign to my soul."

Lyra's mouth twitched. "Stop complaining. You wanted a quest."

"I wanted a quest with… less stalking." He glanced at the tree line where the Taiga's static hiss had returned—thin, persistent, like a bad connection you couldn't fix. "This is not the cozy 'starter zone' vibe."

[Ambient Interference: BLIGHT STATIC — Active]

[Warning: Perception Desync Possible]

Lyra's gaze stayed forward, amber faint in her eyes. "The line is pulling us."

Kenji watched the frost-line skim around a patch of dead ferns. The leaves had curled into repeating spirals. A tidy little pattern, stamped into plant tissue like someone had a template.

He crouched and tilted his head, studying the spiral geometry.

Same repeating pattern as the Grove specimen. Same curl radius. Same spacing. Out here in wild flora, unprompted.

`The corruption doesn't need a host creature. It can write itself into anything organic.`

He didn't say it out loud yet.

Lyra's jaw tightened the same way it had back at the sap prism. She didn't need him to.

They followed the frost-line for nearly an hour. The farther they went, the more the forest looked… unnatural.

Flowers shriveled into black-edged knots. Sap bled from trunks in clean loops that returned to themselves. The Taiga hiss threaded through it all like static under a song.

Kenji catalogued each instance. `The corruption was following the root network. Underground highways. Whatever was behind it used existing biological infrastructure to move.`

`Hmm... Root-to-root propagation. The Grove's ward is acting as a firewall.`

He filed it. Kept walking.

Then the silence changed.

No birds.

No wind.

Just a hush that felt like something had pressed pause.

Kenji lifted two fingers—halt.

Lyra stopped with him, instantly, no question.

A shape burst from the underbrush.

Then another.

Then a third.

Blighted voles the size of pit bulls—fur clotted with oily black resin, eyes lit with that same pale shimmer. Their teeth clicked like stones.

Kenji stepped left, body automatically between them and Lyra.

"Mine," he said.

The first vole lunged.

Kenji's nodachi moved without a thought—Iron-Oak Iaido sliding into motion like a familiar menu option.

The leafblade gave a low, resonant note—soft feedback, clean confirmation.

The vole's bite met the flat of the blade and skidded off. Kenji's counter was immediate: a rising cut that didn't fight the creature's momentum, just redirected it into its own loss.

The edge sheared through blighted flesh with a wet crack. Green motes flared along the wound like ignited sap. The creature hit the ground in two parts, still twitching like it hadn't gotten the memo.

[Forest-Kata — Bloodline Tempo: ACTIVE — Next strike +12% for 5 seconds]

`Buff triggered on the parry-into-kill. System reads the full sequence as one action. If I can chain into the next engagement within five seconds—`

The second vole went low, aiming for Lyra's legs.

Lyra dropped her stance, palms out.

Amber flared.

"Verdant Latch," she said, voice steady. "Bind."

Roots punched through the loam, thick and fast, veined with faint gold. They wrapped the vole mid-leap and yanked it down hard enough to pop the air from its lungs. Thorns punched into resin-hide. Black ichor sprayed in an arc that looked wrong even as it fell—too neat.

A chime flickered across Lyra's vision—Kenji saw it only as a ghost at the edge, like the system was shy around her.

[Spell Codified: Verdant Latch — Tier 1]

[Cost: Stamina — Minor]

[Affinity Response: Positive]

The third vole tried to flank Kenji.

He pivoted, the nodachi already reversing.

Two seconds left on the Tempo window.

Kenji split the vole from skull to tail with one downward strike. The Tempo window flared once and expired on the killing blow.

`Confirmed. Buff doesn't stack, but it applies to the next clean strike if you're fast enough. Parry → kill → reposition → parry → kill. The style wants me aggressive.`

`Iron-Oak Iaido is a counter-attacker's engine disguised as a guard stance. I can work with that.`

Silence returned.

Kenji stood there breathing hard, bark plates shifting as if they were learning his posture. He glanced at Lyra.

She looked steadier than before. Cleaner. Like the Grove lesson had installed a governor on her power.

Lyra's eyes slid over him—quick, assessing, proud. "Try not to get bitten."

Kenji made a face. "I am actively trying."

They moved.

Ten minutes later, the frost-line hooked hard to the northwest and stopped pretending the trail was normal.

A torn druid cloak snagged on a jagged root—moss-woven, Grove-make, but shredded like it had been dragged.

A silver leaf charm lay beneath it, cracked clean in half.

Lyra crouched, hands hovering over the charm without touching.

Her breathing went quiet.

"Eira," she said.

Kenji crouched beside her. He studied the drag marks gouged into the earth.

Too straight. Too continuous.

Boot prints—soft-soled, druid-made—pressed into the dead earth. Days old, maybe weeks, preserved by the lack of anything alive enough to disturb them.

Steady pace at first. Even spacing. Professional.

Then the spacing changed. Shorter. Faster.

Then drag marks.

"They were running," Kenji said quietly. "And then they weren't."

Lyra knelt beside the drag marks. Her palm hovered over the earth, not touching—just listening, the way the Grove woman had taught her.

The amber shimmer in her eyes flared once.

"Blood," she said. "Old. But it's still in the soil. The earth remembers."

[Quest Update: The Missing Circle]

[Clue Found: Archdruid Eira's Charm Fragment]

[Trail Vector: Northwest]

Kenji looked down the trail. The drag marks continued northwest, toward air that smelled less like trees and more like something chemical.

Lyra's jaw flexed. "They were taken. Whatever grabbed them wanted them intact."

She stood. Kenji stood with her, nodachi angled down, ready.

They followed.

The forest leaned in. The air turned metallic. The Blight static thickened until Kenji felt it behind his eyes.

His Claimant Mark pulsed again—harder.

[Status Effect: PRESSURE (Claimant) — Mild]

[Warning: Hostile Interest Increasing]

The corruption channels in the ground thickened as they walked. The veins pulsed in rhythm—slow, steady, like a resting heartbeat.

Lyra looked straight ahead like she'd decided fear wasn't worth the calories.

The ground dropped into a shallow ravine. The corruption veins grew from hairline cracks to full channels, pulsing with pale rhythmic light. All of them pointed the same direction.

Inward.

And the boss arrived.

It rose out of the mud like something that had been assembled wrong on purpose.

A serpent—twenty feet long, thick as Kenji's thigh. Scales sloughed off in wet sheets, revealing muscle that pulsed with repeating black geometry. Its eyes were milky, blind, and it still tracked them perfectly.

Venom hissed where it hit the ground—etching fractal curls into the dirt like the poison had rules.

[Enemy Identified: Blightblood Serpent — Elite Corrupted]

[Hazard: Venom — Phase 1: Paralytic | Phase 2: Necrotic]

[Corruption Signature: ENGINEERED — Repeating Lattice Detected]

`Do NOT get bitten.`

"Yeah," Kenji said aloud. "That is a problem."

Lyra's hands lifted, amber blazing. "I'll hold it. You cut."

Kenji shook his head. "That thing has mass and reach. Your roots held pit bulls. This is a freight train with fangs."

Lyra's jaw set. "Then I slow it. You find the opening."

"Alright." Kenji pulled the nodachi forward into a low guard. "I go in. You control the space."

The serpent struck.

Not a clean lunge—stuttering jerks, like its body skipped frames.

Lyra slammed both palms down.

"Verdant—thorns!"

Briars erupted in a wall—thicker than anything she'd pulled before, darker, drawing on soil that was half-corrupted and angry about it. The snake hit the wall and shredded vines like paper, but the barrier bought half a second.

Kenji sprinted through the gap between the coils, boots slamming corrupted earth, nodachi trailing green motes behind him like a comet tail.

The serpent's head snapped around the briars and came for his chest—faster than anything that size had a right to move.

Kenji planted his feet and met it head-on.

The leafblade rose in a perfect rising block.

leafsteel and fang collided with a deep, resonant *thrum* — like a living tree struck by lightning.

[Skill Codified: Iron Gate / True Parry — Kendo Form]

**Passive:** +18% Parry Timing Window

**Active:** Perfect Redirect (redirect incoming strike with zero counter-momentum, 60-second cooldown)

**Restriction:** Organic Blade Only

*The Wild approves of disciplined defense.*

The impact rang up his arms, but the blade held. For the first time, the system had officially recognized the technique.

`Still too risky for a full commit against something this heavy...`

He threw himself sideways at the last instant, felt the displacement of air as the blunt wedge of the serpent's head passed close enough to ruffle his hair, and came up swinging.

The nodachi caught the snake behind the jaw — a rising diagonal cut that bit through corrupted scales and into the meat beneath. Black ichor sprayed in a pressurized arc. The blade's green veins flared on contact, and the serpent screamed — something between a shriek and a system error.

[Forest-Kata — Bloodline Tempo: ACTIVE]

`Tempo triggered off the dodge? The system read the sidestep as a parry-equivalent. New rule: Tempo doesn't need blade-on-blade. It needs a defensive read into an offensive commitment.`

`Good. Because parrying this thing was never an option.`

The serpent recoiled, head rearing back.

Kenji saw the opening—the underside of the jaw, softer scales, a seam where the corruption hadn't fully armored the flesh.

He stepped in for the killing stroke.

The tail hit him from behind.

He didn't see it. Didn't hear it. Just felt the impact—a wall of scaled muscle slamming into his lower back like a battering ram.

Kenji went airborne.

He hit the ground rolling, nodachi clutched to his chest on pure reflex, and slid six feet through dead earth before stopping against a rock. His spine sang with white-hot agony. The 80% feedback turned the impact into a full-body trauma event.

Kenji wheezed. "Tail… check. Should've… seen it."

The serpent pivoted toward him.

Then it stopped.

Its head swung toward Lyra.

She was kneeling, both palms flat on the earth, and the corruption veins in the ground were darkening around her—being pulled. Drawn toward her hands like she'd become a drain in the center of a poisoned sink.

[Spell Evolving: Verdant Purge (Unstable)]

[Effect: Localized Corruption Absorption — EXPERIMENTAL]

[Warning: Caster Exposure Risk — HIGH]

[Attunement Breakthrough: Verdant Affinity — CONFIRMED]

[Chosen Affinity: Verdant Speaker — TIER 2: Purifier (Nascent)]

Lyra's eyes flew wide.

She hadn't meant to do this.

The corruption was just *answering* her—flooding toward her palms like she'd opened a valve she didn't know existed. Her fingers dug into the dirt, shaking, not from effort but from the sheer voltage of what was moving through her.

"What—" she started, voice cracking. The amber in her eyes wasn't just glowing. It was *blazing*—brighter than anything Kenji had seen from her, brighter than the Grove Heart-Tree, like something ancient had looked through her and decided to stay.

"Chosen Affinity: Purifier," Lyra whispered.

A sound escaped her—half laugh, half gasp—like someone who'd reached for a light switch and accidentally grabbed a live power line.

"Kenji," she breathed. "I can *feel* it. All of it. The whole network. It's—" She swallowed. "It's so much bigger than what we've seen."

The serpent felt it. Whatever the blight was, Lyra was *hurting* it—pulling corruption out of the ground the way a surgeon pulls shrapnel. Its body shuddered, movements skipping worse, like someone had yanked a wire out of its nervous system.

It lunged for Lyra.

Kenji moved before his body was ready.

He launched off the rock—spine screaming, lungs half-collapsed—and threw himself into the serpent's path.

Not a dodge. Not a parry.

A block.

The serpent's head struck his left side. The fangs—two black crescents the length of kitchen knives—punched through bark-plate armor, past hide, into the meat of his forearm.

Pain hit like molten glass.

[Debuff Applied: BLIGHTBLOOD VENOM]

[Stacks: 1/5]

[Time to Paralysis: 05:00]

[Time to Necrotic Failure: 11:00]

At 80% feedback, every microsecond registered—fangs scraping bone, venom spreading like cold electricity.

Kenji twisted with the bite—turning damage into leverage—and drove the nodachi up under the serpent's jaw.

The leafblade sang.

Green-gold light snapped along the blade's vein lines and detonated into the serpent's head. Resin and scale burst in a spray that steamed as it fell.

The body thrashed—once, twice—then collapsed into the mud.

The ground shook.

[BOSS DEFEATED: Blightblood Serpent]

[SKILL CREATED: Bloodtide Counter — Sacrificial Intercept]

Effect: When blocking lethal damage intended for an ally, next offensive strike gains +40% damage and guaranteed critical.

Restriction: Triggers only on intentional self-sacrifice. System verifies intent.

Cost: Damage sustained is not reduced.

[Note: The Wild rewards those who bleed for others.]

Intent-verified. The system had checked whether he meant to take the hit or just failed to dodge.

Kenji stared at the skill description while his arm screamed.

`It's not watching what I do. It's reading what I choose.`

Iron-Oak Iaido: he chose to fight with a stick instead of running. Forest-Kata: he chose to train through pain instead of resting. Bloodtide Counter: he chose to bleed so she didn't have to.

`The system doesn't care about my stats. It cares about my character.`

`…That's either the most beautiful game design I've ever seen, or the cruelest.`

The venom didn't wait for him to decide which.

His arm swelled. Black webbing crawled under the skin like ink finding veins.

[Blightblood Venom — Stacks: 2/5]

[Time to Paralysis: 03:58]

[Time to Necrotic Failure: 09:43]

Kenji staggered back.

Lyra was on him in two strides.

For half a second, the predator, the druid, the woman who stared down monsters without blinking—she cracked. Her eyes went wide. Her breath caught. Her hands hovered over his wound like she was afraid touching him would make it real.

Then the crack sealed.

And what replaced it was focus. The kind that doesn't negotiate.

"Down," she ordered.

Kenji tried to joke but failed halfway. "If I die, tell the Grove... to not turn... my sword... into... salad."

Lyra grabbed the edge of his armor and yanked. "Kenji."

That tone shut him up.

He dropped against a mossy boulder near the ravine lip. The cave mouth loomed twenty yards away—black, wet, pulsing faintly with the same wrong geometry.

Lyra ripped his forearm plates free—hands sure, efficient, no hesitation.

"In my defense," Kenji muttered through gritted teeth, "I was expecting it to swallow, not bite."

Lyra didn't look up. "Stay still."

"I'm great at still. I'm basically a statue with anxiety."

Lyra's mouth twitched once—then vanished under focus.

She pulled the root-cork vial of healing sap from her pouch, uncorked it with her teeth, spit the cork aside, and poured a thin line along the bite punctures.

The sap hissed as it met the venom. Like two systems arguing over who owned the tissue.

Lyra placed one palm over the wound and the other flat against Kenji's sternum.

Skin contact. Heat. A controlled breath.

The Purifier breakthrough hadn't just given her a title—it had given her *resolution.* Where before she'd been listening to the corruption like a foreign language heard through a wall, now she was reading it like a blueprint she'd memorized in a dream. The venom architecture was *visible* to her. She could see where it branched, where it anchored, where it was trying to build.

And she could see exactly where to cut.

"It's structured," Lyra murmured, half to Kenji, half to herself. "The venom. It's not chaos. It builds in sequences. Like it's following *instructions.*"

Her voice carried a new weight. *Recognition.* Like a mechanic looking under a hood for the first time and realizing she already knew where every bolt went.

Kenji felt it—Lyra pulling the poison like a stubborn thread caught in fabric. The venom fought back. His arm spasmed. Black webbing surged toward his elbow.

Lyra's jaw tightened. She breathed out slow and steady, and the sap-glow brightened under her hand. A thin braid of green light formed between her fingers and the wound—tight, controlled, like a line being drawn through a mess.

The venom shifted. Moving. Dragged—inch by inch—toward Lyra's palm, where the healing sap caught it and burned it down into something the body could survive.

[Warning: Verdant Overreach Approaching Threshold]

[Ward Response: NONE (Out of Grove Range)]

[Risk: Self-Taint — Increasing]

Lyra adjusted instantly—breath slower, palms softer, control tighter. She didn't force.

She kept the line.

Kenji watched her face—sweat at her temples, eyes molten amber, focus so hard it looked like fury.

`If I die here, I die watching the bravest person I've ever met refuse to let me go.`

`That's not the worst way to go. But I'd rather live.`

He stayed still.

[Blightblood Venom — Stacks: 1/5]

[Time to Paralysis: 02:10]

[Time to Necrotic Failure: 07:55]

Lyra sucked in a sharp breath. She reached for the serpent's corpse, then touched the mud beside it.

Roots rose like careful fingers and plucked a venom gland from the ruined head, lifting it to her without letting it smear corruption on her skin.

"Gross," Kenji managed.

Lyra didn't look at him. "Useful."

She crushed the gland into the sap vial—quick, precise—and the liquid inside flashed green, then steadied.

`She just reverse-engineered a boss monster's venom into a cure using magic she unlocked fifteen minutes ago.`

[Item Crafted: Verdant Antivenom (Crude)]

[Effect: Neutralizes Paralytic + Slows Necrotic Spread]

[Warning: Dose Window — Short]

Lyra tilted the vial to Kenji's lips. "Drink."

Kenji obeyed.

The antivenom hit his throat like wildfire and cold water at the same time.

His arm burned. The black webbing shuddered. Then it started to retreat.

[Blightblood Venom — Neutralized]

[Status: Stable]

[Residual: Arm Trauma — Moderate]

Kenji sagged back against the boulder, chest heaving.

"For the record," he croaked, "that tasted like someone liquefied a forest fire and added a hint of snake bile. Zero stars. Would not recommend to friends."

Lyra stayed close, hand still on his sternum for one extra beat—making sure his heartbeat was real, not just a number on a screen.

"You absolute idiot," she whispered. "You stepped in front of it."

"It was going for you."

"I could have dodged."

"You were mid-cast. Palms on the ground. No exit."

Lyra's jaw clenched. Her eyes were bright—not amber now. Just bright.

"Don't do that again," she said.

Kenji looked up at her. Sweat on her brow. Dirt on her cheek. Torn rags and trembling hands and fire in her eyes that hadn't fully faded.

"Can't promise that," he said.

Lyra's grip on his sternum tightened. For a moment, the air between them held everything they hadn't said—every loaded glance, every near-touch, every joke that covered something deeper.

Then she pulled away, controlled, and stood.

Her hands didn't shake.

Her eyes stayed bright.

**Bloodtide Counter — Sacrificial Intercept.**

*The Wild rewards those who bleed for others.*

"Sacrifice-based combat skills," Kenji murmured. "I'm speedrunning the martyr build."

Lyra's voice came from the serpent's corpse, where she was already cataloguing remains. "Did you say something?"

"Nothing. Just reading my obituary-in-progress."

"Drama queen."

"Trauma queen," Kenji corrected. "I earned the upgrade."

They rearmed fast. Kenji refastened the bark plates with one hand, jaw clenched against the ache. Lyra tightened her cloak, then lifted her gaze past the dead serpent toward the cave mouth.

The drag marks from the druid trail continued past the serpent's territory—fainter now, but visible. Whatever had taken the leadership had come through here.

"That thing was stationed," Lyra said. "Like a sentry."

Kenji nodded slowly. "Which means the path leads somewhere worth guarding."

As Lyra cinched her cloak, Kenji's gaze caught something on the ravine's upper lip. Boot prints. Heavy treads—manufactured soles, the kind you bought from a Citadel outfitter with real currency.

Fresh.

Three sets, moving parallel to their trail, stopping at a vantage point that overlooked the clearing.

They'd watched the fight.

And they'd moved on.

Kenji's Mark pulsed—not the dull throb of corruption proximity. A sharper note. Like it was trying to ping something that was pinging it back.

[Claimant Mark: Secondary Signature Detected — Fading]

[Range: Recent Proximity]

"Lyra," Kenji said quietly.

She followed his gaze to the boot prints.

Her expression didn't change. But her hand moved to the sap vial and secured it inside her cloak.

"The whale," she said. Not a question.

"Or someone like him," Kenji said. "Three sets. Citadel gear. They had a front-row seat to our boss fight and decided not to introduce themselves."

The boot prints led northwest. Same direction as the cave.

"We're not the only ones following the trail," he said.

Lyra's jaw set. "Then we move faster."

The stone around the cave mouth was veined with black lines that repeated in clean curves—too deliberate to be rot.

Kenji's Claimant Mark pulsed once—hard enough to make his teeth click.

[Corruption Density: CRITICAL]

[Unknown Entity Signature Detected]

[Warning: Claimant Marks Amplify Detection Within This Zone]

Lyra looked at Kenji, eyes hot, expression steady.

"You good enough to swing?" she asked.

Kenji adjusted the leafblade nodachi on his shoulder. The weapon hummed like it was ready to argue with anything inside that cave.

"Yeah," he said. "Let's go meet whoever thinks rot is a craft."

They stepped into the dark together.

The cave swallowed their light.

And the Blight static inside sounded… pleased.
