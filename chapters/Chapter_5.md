# Chapter 5: The Throat of It

The descent simplified everything into two facts: the air had a heartbeat, and it was not theirs.

The cave swallowed their light and gave back a hum that wasn’t wind. It was a constant, low-frequency crawl that pried at the back of Kenji’s teeth like a tuning fork held to bone. The walls began as rock and turned… purposeful. Veins of pale geometry threaded the stone in repeating arcs, curling back into spirals that matched the black frost-markings they’d followed through the Taiga. The lattice didn’t look like decay. It looked like an interface wearing rot for camouflage.

His Claimant Mark pulsed warm, then hot.

“Feels like the system stapled a beacon to my hand,” he muttered.

Lyra’s shadow-moss cloak drank what little glow the bioluminescent fungus gave them, turning her into a moving absence. “It’s listening to you,” she said. “And through you.”

They passed boot prints — heavy, Citadel-issue treads. Three sets. Then scuffs. Drag lines. The tidy geometry on the walls thickened as the air turned metallic.

The corridor opened.

Kenji stopped.

It wasn’t a cavern. It was a lobby.

Bone-coral pillars arched into a vaulted ceiling. Root-bundles ran along the walls like conduit. Bioluminescent rot had been coaxed into even pools like downlights. The place looked less like stone than a biomaterials lab that decided to be a church.

Kenji’s gamer brain filed it: This isn’t a dungeon. Someone lives here.

“Alive,” Lyra whispered. “But wrong.” Her eyes had that faint amber again. “The lattice has a rhythm. Someone is keeping time.”

They turned a corner and found the missing druids.

They stood in alcoves carved from the wall — nine recesses, seven occupied — eyes open and empty. Bark-armor had fused with pale geometry, skin gone translucent where the lattice rose through veins like frost beneath ice. The faintest green still floated deep in their eyes, like glow trapped behind the wrong glass.

Lyra’s breath left her, not as a sob but as the violent silence that comes just before one. Her fingers hovered and didn’t touch.

[QUEST UPDATE: The Missing Circle — STATUS: LOCATED (Corrupted)]

A druid stepped out of an alcove.

He didn’t blink. His staff came up, and the roots in the staff’s head unbraided like barbed wire coming alive.

“Kenji,” Lyra breathed.

“I’ve got him. Don’t touch the others.” Kenji slid into low guard, leafblade nodachi a green line.

The druid moved with Grove efficiency inverted — root-snare lashes that grabbed air and wrote it backwards, thorns growing in instead of out. Nature magic in reverse.

The first lash came for Kenji’s ankles.

He stepped over and let it hiss under his boot heel.

“KOTE.”

The nodachi clipped the staff at the juncture where wood met blight-vein. Sparks like sap-lit embers.

The second lash wrapped his calf and jerked. Kenji let the pull throw him forward instead of back, used the lost balance as fuel, and drew a rising line under the druid’s ribs.

“MEN.”

The blade bit. Black ichor sprayed in a precise arc — too clean for blood.

Lyra knelt, palms down. “Latch.”

Verdant roots punched from the floor, seized the corrupted ankles, and pinned them. Her breath stayed steady this time — the Grove lesson had installed a governor on her will. She didn’t force. She asked like a surgeon who’d earned the right to cut.

The druid’s eyes flickered — green, then pale, then green again as if someone behind the glass was pounding to get out.

“Don’t kill him,” Lyra said. “Not yet.”

The staff bucked with a blighted surge. Kenji took it on the flat. The impact rang up his arms with that satisfying tree-struck note.

He rode the recoil and used the redirect to step past the guard, cutting the lattice at the clavicle where it had knitted enchantment into flesh.

The body folded.

The green in the eyes went bright for one blink.

Thank—

The light went out.

Lyra didn’t cry.

Kenji let the silence stand with them like a third person.

A voice slid into the quiet.

“You broke my favorite one,” it said conversationally. The voice didn’t come from a throat. It came from everywhere. “That took me three days to calibrate.”

Lyra’s head came up, eyes hunting for a mouth.

“Who are you?” Kenji asked the walls.

“Someone who remembers what it felt like to fail an interview to a machine,” the cave said through its own geometry. “Someone the Grove would have turned away at the threshold for the wrong kind of anger. I’m impressed you got this far, Claimants. I didn’t think the Grove would share its pets.”

“Not pets,” Lyra said flatly. “Wardens.”

“Ah.” The voice smiled. “Promotions already.”

Sable didn’t materialize. She breathed through the network. Curiosity hummed. Interest. Calculation.

“You can leave,” she offered. “I’ll let you go. Your little circle can keep its tree. I just want the deep.”

“No,” Lyra said.

“Of course not,” Sable sighed. “You’re Purifier. It’s in the job description.”

They found the Citadel survivor wedged into a cleavage of stone like a prayer refused. His eyes had the thousand-yard glaze of a man who’d realized his account balance didn’t buy him grace here.

“She didn’t touch us,” he whispered. “She didn’t need to. The walls ate Cal. The floor took Taye. I ran. I’ve been running.”

“Bound?” Kenji asked.

The man’s mouth worked. “Unbound. We thought… we thought we could brute-force it.”

“Can you walk?”

He nodded like lying.

A rustle of root. Two more alcoves let go of their occupants. A third creaked.

“Back,” Kenji said, leafblade up. “Fall back.”

Lyra sealed the corridor behind them with a living door that groaned like a tree learning to say “no.”

The cave’s hum followed them out.

“You’ll come back,” Sable said, gentle as winter. “Purifiers always do.”

They stepped into the Taiga’s hiss and didn’t stop until the frost-line returned.

Kenji looked back at the black mouth of the cave and rolled his sore shoulder.

“We’re not strong enough.”

Lyra’s jaw set. “Then we will be.”
