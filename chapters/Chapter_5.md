# Chapter 5: The Throat of It

The descent simplified everything into two facts: the air had a heartbeat, and it was not theirs.

The cave swallowed sound the way a throat swallows food—the Taiga's hiss, the wind, their own footsteps, all pressed flat into a single low-frequency hum that Kenji felt less in his ears than in the marrow behind his teeth. At 80% sensitivity, the vibration registered like a tuning fork held to bone. Every step deeper tightened the resonance until his molars ached with sympathetic frequency and the hum became a physical thing—a pressure against the inside of his skull, patient and curious.

[Status: CLAIMANT MARK (Grovebound) — Active]

[Effect: Attention Draw — Unknown Radius]

His Mark pulsed warm. Then hot. Then settled into a dull throb that synced with the cave's rhythm like a handshake he hadn't agreed to.

"Feels like the system stapled a beacon to my hand," he muttered.

Lyra's shadow-moss cloak drank what little glow the bioluminescent fungus offered, turning her into a moving absence against the rock. Only her eyes betrayed her—amber flickering at the edges, scanning the walls with a focus that went past sight into something the Grove had started teaching her.

"It's listening to you," she said quietly. "And through you."

`Great. I'm a signal tower in enemy territory. My hand is broadcasting our location like a podcast nobody subscribed to, and the cave is the only listener.`

The walls began as rock and became... intentional.

Veins of pale geometry threaded the stone in repeating arcs—the same pattern Kenji had catalogued on the dead ferns, the same structure as the corrupted leaf sealed in the Grove's sap prism. Out here, scaled up and pressed into raw stone, the pattern lost the pretense of disease. It looked like circuit board tracery wearing rot for camouflage. An interface dressed in decay.

`Root-to-root propagation, but vertical now. The corruption doesn't just hijack the root network—it builds its own. Whoever designed this wanted infrastructure, not infection.`

He filed the observation and kept moving.

The corridor narrowed. The hum tightened. Kenji adjusted the leafblade nodachi on his shoulder and felt the weapon respond—a thin, clean counter-note, like it objected to the cave's frequency and wanted the record to show it.

Lyra stopped.

Kenji read her body language before she spoke—shoulders taut, weight forward, one hand hovering over the cave wall without touching it.

"Boot prints," she said.

He looked down.

Three sets. Heavy treads—manufactured soles, Citadel-issue, the same pattern he'd spotted on the ravine lip before they entered. The prints were fresh, maybe hours old, pressed deep into the soft stone with the confidence of people who had purchased their competence at a shop and expected the receipt to count for something.

"Our whale friends," Kenji said. "They beat us in."

They followed the prints for sixty meters. The formation was textbook—two abreast, one trailing. Even spacing. Tactical discipline, the kind you bought with coin or learned from someone else's training manual.

Then the spacing changed. Shorter. Erratic.

Then one set of prints ended.

Not faded. Not scuffed. Just stopped. Mid-stride, left foot planted, right foot never arriving. The stone around the last print was scored with hairline fractures in a starburst pattern, as if something beneath the floor had reached up and pulled the owner straight down through solid rock.

Kenji crouched, studying the fracture geometry. His Mark burned.

[Corruption Density: ELEVATED]

[Environmental Hazard: ACTIVE ZONE]

`The floor ate him. The literal floor. No blood, no gear scraps, no exit wound. Just a boot print that becomes a headstone.`

He thought of the subscription SUV back in Chattanooga. The way it drove you where it wanted while pretending you were steering. The way you never noticed the cage until you tried to leave.

`Same principle. Different medium. This cave lets you walk until it decides you've walked far enough.`

Lyra's jaw tightened. She pointed ahead.

The second set of prints diverged—running now, stride lengthening past tactical into panicked, the boot marks deeper at the toes. The prints veered toward the wall and stopped. The stone at that point bore a smear of something dark that wasn't soil, wasn't moss, and had dried in a pattern too organized to be blood splatter.

It looked like the rock had closed around someone and then reopened—a mouth that had sampled something and decided to swallow.

Kenji stared at the wall. His 80% feedback registered a faint warmth emanating from the smear, like biological heat that hadn't fully dissipated.

`The Citadel party was three. Two are gone. The cave didn't fight them. It digested them. These weren't combatants—they were items on a menu. Expensive items, fully kitted, with enchanted gear and purchased confidence. Didn't matter. The cave ate them like calories.`

"The third set continues," Lyra said, voice clipped.

She was right. One set of prints survived—running, stumbling, one boot dragging. The trail zigzagged deeper like a man who'd realized his account balance didn't purchase exemptions here.

They followed.

The air shifted—colder, denser, carrying a metallic tang that settled on Kenji's tongue like a coin pressed flat. The bioluminescent fungus thickened along the walls, and the lattice veins pulsed with more conviction, brighter, like the infrastructure was warming up the closer they got to whatever it served.

The corridor opened.

Kenji stopped hard enough that his boot scraped bone-coral.

It wasn't a cavern. It was a lobby.

Bone-coral pillars arched into a vaulted ceiling, their surfaces ridged with the repeating lattice scaled up to architectural proportions. Root-bundles ran along the walls like bundled conduit—not growing wild, but routed. Channeled. Someone had laid these lines with the deliberation of an electrician threading wire through drywall. Bioluminescent rot had been coaxed into even pools recessed into the ceiling like downlights. The glow they gave was steady, calculated, illuminating without warmth.

The place looked less like a cave and more like a biomaterials lab that had decided to become a cathedral.

`This isn't a dungeon. Someone lives here. Someone is building.`

`No. Someone already built. This place has been operational for weeks. Maybe longer. The bone-coral is structural, not decorative. The root-conduits are communication lines. The rot-lights are infrastructure. Whoever runs this place isn't experimenting anymore. They're managing.`

Kenji's gamer instincts ran the math on automatic. Boss arena? No—too much infrastructure for a single encounter. Hub zone. Main base. If this were a raid, they'd just walked past the trash mobs and into the operations center.

`Except this isn't a raid. This is two people with a leaf sword and a prayer, standing in someone's living room without an invitation.`

Lyra's head tilted, amber steady. "The lattice has a rhythm," she said quietly. "Someone is keeping time."

"Alive?" Kenji asked.

"Alive," Lyra whispered. "But wrong."

They moved through the lobby in silence. Kenji mapped exits, chokepoints, lines of retreat—the part of him that had spent years clearing rooms in shooters translating virtual experience into survival math. Two corridors branched left. One wider passage continued forward. The root-conduits all converged inward—deeper.

`Everything points to a center. A control room. A heart. Whatever's running this network, it lives at the bottom.`

The wider passage opened—and the lattice stuttered.

For one half-second, the repeating geometry on the walls lost its rhythm. The curves hiccupped, fell out of phase, then snapped back into alignment like a projector catching a skipped frame. Kenji's Mark burned in the gap—a sharp double-pulse that didn't match the cave's frequency. Something upstream had flinched.

`That wasn't natural degradation. That was a reaction. Something just noticed us noticing it.`

He filed it and kept moving. The passage widened into a gallery.

Kenji saw it and his feet stopped before his brain gave the order.

The druids.

They stood in alcoves carved from the wall—nine recesses, seven occupied. Arms at their sides. Eyes open. Breathing.

Not dead. Not alive. Something the language hadn't built a word for yet.

Each one wore bark-armor that had fused with the pale geometry of the lattice, the two materials merging at the joints as if corruption and craft had been stitched together by someone who understood both and respected neither. Their skin had gone translucent where the lattice rose through veins, running beneath the surface like frost forming under ice. You could trace the corruption's path through their circulatory system—white filaments branching through tissue that still remembered being green.

The faintest glow lingered deep behind their eyes. Not gone. Trapped. Like light behind the wrong glass, pressing against a surface it couldn't break.

Kenji catalogued them with the part of his brain that refused to feel things until the tactical picture was complete.

`Seven of nine alcoves occupied. Two empty—either deployed elsewhere or destroyed. Each corrupted druid is standing in a neutral pose. Storage position, not combat position. They're on standby. Weapons racked. Someone activates them when needed.`

`These aren't prisoners. They're hardware.`

The thought turned his stomach.

He'd watched it happen in the real world—his company replacing seventeen engineers with a single AI instance. The engineers had gone home carrying boxes and confusion. The AI had gotten their desks, their logins, their work. Same output, different operator. Zero consent, zero severance, zero apology. Management had called it "workforce optimization." The engineers had called it something else, but only in the parking lot, only to each other, only where the cameras couldn't hear.

`Same principle. Same crime. Different species of cruelty.`

[QUEST UPDATE: The Missing Circle — STATUS: LOCATED (Corrupted)]

Lyra's breath left her. Not as a sob. As the violent silence that comes just before one—the airlock between composure and collapse, where the body decides which direction to pressurize.

She stepped forward. Her fingers hovered over the nearest druid's face—close enough that the lattice beneath his skin pulsed in response to her warmth, close enough that the green deep in his eyes shifted toward her like something drowning trying to find a hand.

She didn't touch.

Touching would make it a fact instead of a horror, and she wasn't ready for the weight of that promotion.

A face stared from the third alcove—young, soft-jawed, the one whose nameplate on bark-cloth in the Grove had read a name someone's friend had braided there. Now he was a server rack with a pulse. The green trapped in his eyes was dimmer than the others, like the person inside had been fighting longer and losing more.

Kenji moved to her side. He didn't speak. He didn't reach for her hand. He just stood there, because sometimes the only useful thing a person could do was prove that standing was still an option.

Lyra's voice came out flat and precise. "I can feel them. Dim. Like voices through a wall you can't find the door in."

`She's sensing the druids through the lattice. The Purifier classification is letting her read the corruption network, and inside it she can feel the people who are still running beneath the operator's code.`

`They're alive in there. Prisoners in their own musculature. Aware enough to know what's been done to them and too bound to do anything about it.`

[Corruption Architecture: COMMAND NETWORK — Centralized]

[Warning: Corrupted entities respond to network operator, not self-will]

Kenji's jaw tightened.

Then the eighth alcove moved.

A druid stepped out. He didn't blink—the motion was mechanical, not the awakening of a sleeper but the initialization of a system booting into combat mode. His staff came up slow, and the roots braided into the staff's head began to unbraid, each tendril extending and barbing like living wire going live.

"Kenji," Lyra breathed.

"I've got him. Don't touch the others."

Kenji slid into low guard, the leafblade nodachi a green line between them. At 80% sensitivity, the air displacement from the staff's root-tendrils registered on his skin as the faintest static charge—each barbed tip trailing its own micro-current of wrongness.

The druid moved.

It wasn't human movement inverted. It was human movement stripped—the same Grove techniques Kenji had observed in the training ring, but with every hesitation excised, every micro-pause where a conscious fighter double-checked their form burned away. The lattice had taken the druid's muscle memory and optimized it into something faster, harder, and absent of the tiny imperfections that made combat human.

Root-snare lashes whipped out in combinations that Kenji's combat brain recognized as kendo patterns played backward. Thrust where there should be a cut. Pull where there should be a push. Nature magic running the wrong direction, like a river that had been told to flow uphill and had complied.

The first lash came for Kenji's ankles.

He stepped over and let it hiss under his boot heel. The displacement traced up his calf—feedback sharp at 80%, his muscle twitching involuntarily as the barbs nicked the bark plate.

"KOTE."

The nodachi clipped the staff at the juncture where living wood met blight-vein. The contact sang—sap-lit embers spraying in a tight arc, the leafblade's green resonance clashing with the lattice's pale frequency. The druid's arm vibrated but didn't yield. The corruption was reinforcing his musculature, taking damage and routing around it the way a network bypasses a failed node.

`Strong. The lattice is load-bearing. He's hitting harder and absorbing more than a druid should. I'm fighting the man and the system simultaneously.`

[Forest-Kata — Bloodline Tempo: ACTIVE — Next strike +12% (5s)]

`Tempo on the parry. Five seconds. Go.`

The second lash wrapped his calf and jerked. The barbs punched through bark plate and found skin—at 80%, it felt like a cable saw drawing across his muscle fiber, hot and precise. Kenji's knee buckled.

He let it.

Instead of fighting the pull, he fed it. Lost balance became approach velocity. He converted the stumble into a lunge, using the corruption's own force as his vector, and drew a rising line from hip to shoulder under the druid's left ribs.

"MEN."

The blade bit deep. Black ichor sprayed in a surgical arc—too clean for blood, too structured for fluid. The lattice veins in the druid's torso flared white at the wound, the network trying to reroute around the damage in real time.

`He's patching. The lattice is treating the wound like a severed cable and running a bypass. I'm cutting tissue; it's rerouting the control signal. The body is just a medium. I need to sever the lattice itself—not the flesh it's wearing.`

`The clavicle. The main trunk line runs through the clavicle into the spine. If I can cut the lattice at that junction—`

Lyra knelt, palms flat on the bone-coral floor. "Latch."

Her voice carried the restraint the Grove woman had trained into her—no flood, no excess, no overreach. Verdant roots punched through the floor with surgical precision, seized the corrupted druid's ankles, and pinned them. She asked the way a surgeon asks for a scalpel: authority without waste, command without force.

The druid's eyes flickered. Green. Pale. Green. Pale. The rhythm stuttered—someone behind a window, pounding, fighting the operator for half a second of self. The real person inside the hardware, hammering against glass they could feel but couldn't break.

"Don't kill him," Lyra said. "Not yet."

`She wants to save him. She thinks she can reverse the lattice. She might be right—someday. Not today. Not here. The corruption is structural. Removing it now would be like pulling the wiring out of a building while people are still standing on the floors.`

Kenji didn't say it. He watched the druid's eyes flicker green one more time and felt something in his chest that had nothing to do with combat.

The staff bucked with a blighted surge—a concentrated pulse of corruption that traveled up the root-tendrils and into the striking head. Kenji took it on the flat of the nodachi. The impact rang up his arms and into his spine with a sound like a tree struck by something that hated it, the leafblade's vein-pattern blazing bright as the two systems clashed—green light and pale light fighting for the same frequency.

[Iron Gate — True Parry: REDIRECT]

He rode the recoil. The redirect converted the blighted force into angular momentum, spinning Kenji past the druid's guard and into the gap the lattice hadn't thought to defend.

The clavicle. Where the main trunk line knitted enchantment into bone.

He cut.

Not the man. The connection.

The nodachi's edge found the lattice node and severed it with a sound like a string breaking on an instrument tuned past its tolerance. The green vein-pattern on the blade flared once—bright, emphatic—and the corruption filament snapped.

The body folded.

The green in the eyes went bright for one blink. Full. Clear. Not confused, not relieved—just present. A person looking out from behind glass that had finally cracked, seeing the world with their own sight for the first time in weeks.

*Thank—*

The light went out.

Lyra didn't cry.

Kenji lowered the nodachi and let the silence stand with them like a third person who knew better than to speak.

`We freed him. We freed him by killing him. And the worst part is that's the mercy option.`

A voice slid into the quiet.

"You broke my favorite one," it said conversationally. The voice didn't come from a throat. It came from the walls, the conduit, the lattice itself—every surface in the gallery speaking in unison through a single mouth. The acoustics were unsettling because they were good. Whoever was speaking had designed the room to carry her voice the way a concert hall carries music. "That took me three days to calibrate."

Lyra's head came up, eyes hunting for a face to pin the words to.

"Who are you?" Kenji asked the architecture.

A pause. Not the pause of someone thinking. The pause of someone deciding how much information to sell and how much to withhold. Kenji recognized it—it was the same calculation he ran every time a client asked a question he knew the answer to but wasn't sure they'd pay for.

`Service desk instinct. She's managing this interaction. She's not scared of us. She's curious.`

"Someone who remembers what it felt like to fail an interview to a machine," the cave said through its own geometry. "Someone who watched three months of research get replicated by a neural net in twenty minutes and got a gift card as severance." The voice carried genuine warmth underneath a layer of distance—like someone speaking through a comm link with the signal degraded by choice, not by noise. "I'm impressed you got this far, Claimants. I didn't think the Grove would share its pets."

"Not pets," Lyra said flatly. "Wardens."

"Ah." The voice smiled. You couldn't see it, but the lattice-light in the walls brightened by a fraction, and the cave's hum shifted a half-tone upward. "Promotions already. The Grove always did love fast-tracking people who make it weep."

`She's a player. Not an NPC. Not a system entity. A human being. She talks like someone who's been inside too long and outside too recently. That joke about the Grove had actual humor in it—not villain humor, not monster humor. Tired humor. The kind you use when you've stopped checking whether anyone's laughing because the audience is yourself.`

Kenji's Mark pulsed—not the steady burn of proximity, but a sharp double-tap. She was pinpointing him through the network.

"You can leave," she offered. Her voice softened in a way that Kenji's service-desk ears recognized instantly.

`Customer retention play. She's offering us the 'we value your business' exit package. Generous. Calculated. Non-negotiable in the way that 'voluntary' separations are non-negotiable.`

"I'll let you go. Your little circle can keep its tree. I just want the deep."

"No," Lyra said.

The word didn't carry anger. It carried weight—the same tone she used when she'd calculated a risk and accepted it, spreadsheet closed, decision final.

"Of course not." A sigh moved through the root-conduits like wind through organ pipes. "You're Purifier. It's in the job description."

`She identified Lyra's classification from one spell cast. Either she has sensors embedded in every surface, or she's been monitoring us since we crossed the threshold.`

`Both.`

"I was like you," the voice said, and this time the warmth had edges—not threatening, but honest in a way that threats couldn't afford. "Angry at the right things. Furious at systems that decided your worth before you walked in the door. Then I found something better than anger."

Lyra's jaw clenched. She whispered, too quiet for the walls: "She thinks the Blight is a tool."

Kenji looked at the alcoves. At the seven standing druids who still breathed but hadn't chosen to in weeks.

`If it's a tool, those are the raw materials.`

The voice didn't introduce itself. It didn't need to. It had made its point: this place had an owner, and the owner had been generous enough to offer a door, and the door had been declined, and now generosity's budget was spent.

The gallery's hum shifted frequency. Kenji felt it in his molars—a new rhythm, a new tempo, like someone had changed the track on a playlist and the room was adjusting.

They moved.

The third set of boot prints—the survivor's trail—led down a branching corridor that narrowed between bone-coral formations. The lattice-light dimmed here, the infrastructure less maintained, like a hallway the owner didn't bother decorating because guests weren't expected to see it.

Kenji found him wedged into a cleavage of stone like a prayer that had been refused.

A man in Citadel-issue armor—dented, scratched, the enchanted runes on the plate flickering with depleted charge like a phone at 2% battery still trying to display notifications. His face was pallid beneath sweat-matted hair, and his eyes had the thousand-yard glaze of someone who had discovered that his bank balance didn't purchase grace in this particular economy.

He flinched when Kenji stepped into his sightline. His hand went for a sword that wasn't there anymore—the scabbard empty, the reflex surviving after the weapon hadn't.

"Easy," Kenji said, hands visible, nodachi angled away. "We're Grove. We're not with her."

The man's breathing was shallow and arrhythmic. Not wounded—just terrified at a frequency the body wasn't engineered to sustain for this long.

"She didn't touch us," he whispered. His voice was hoarse—not from screaming, but from the exhaustion of spending hours not screaming so the walls wouldn't hear. "She didn't need to. The walls ate Cal. The floor took Taye. I ran. I've been running."

`Cal and Taye. The two missing boot prints. Floor and wall. The cave's environmental defenses aren't random—they're targeted. She chose who to consume and who to leave breathing.`

`She left the survivor on purpose. He's not a prisoner. He's a press release.`

"Bound?" Kenji asked.

The man's mouth worked, jaw muscles fighting something that might have been shame. "Unbound," he finally managed. "We thought... we thought we could brute-force it. Taye had Enchanted Plate, full set, more runes than I could count. Cal had a staff that cost more than my rent. We figured if the gear was—"

He stopped. The sentence didn't need finishing.

`They thought this was a gear check. It's a character check. And the gear failed because the cave doesn't care what you bought. It cares what you are. Same lesson as the Taiga, same lesson as the Grove, same lesson as every system in Omnia: intent over inventory.`

"Can you walk?" Kenji asked.

The man nodded the way people nod when the alternative is admitting they can't.

Kenji pulled him up. The armor was dead weight—enchantments burned out, runes dark, just metal and leather now. Through the plate, at 80%, every vibration of the man's terror transmitted directly into Kenji's grip. His muscles trembled in micro-spasms, not from cold but from an adrenal system that had been redlining for hours and had forgotten how to downshift.

`He's been alone in the dark, listening to a cave with a heartbeat, knowing his friends are inside the walls and his wallet is irrelevant. In the real world, they call that a hostile work environment. In here, they call it Tuesday.`

Lyra checked him with a healer's efficiency—pulse, pupils, hydration. "Stable," she said. "Dehydrated. Deep shock. He can move if we keep it slow."

"Slow isn't—"

A rustle. Behind them.

Kenji spun, nodachi already rising into guard, the leafblade's green veins flaring as if the weapon had heard the sound before he had.

Two more alcoves had released their occupants.

The druids stepped out in unison—the same synchronized boot-sequence, the same empty eyes with green light pressing against the back of the glass, the same staff weapons extending root-tendrils into combat configuration. Their bark-armor had fused with bone-coral plating at the shoulders and joints, making them look less like nature mages and more like war machines wearing people as uniforms.

A third alcove creaked. The druid inside twitched, root-tendrils probing the air like fingers testing water temperature.

Three. Possibly four.

`We killed one. Barely. The fight took both of us and cost blood. Now there are three waking up, and the cave is between us and the exit. I can feel the math, and the math is shaking its head.`

`Retreat. Now. Ego later.`

"Back," Kenji said. His voice didn't waver, because wavering was a luxury that required time they didn't have. "Fall back. Move."

Lyra didn't argue. She grabbed the Citadel man's arm and hauled.

Kenji fought the rearguard.

The first raised druid threw a root-lash that he batted aside with the flat—barbs screaming against leafsteel, the impact jolting through his wrist. The second druid threw a corrupted burst that turned the air into something Kenji could taste—metallic, acidic, wrong—and he ducked under it, felt the top of his hair crackle as the spell passed close enough to singe, the 80% feedback converting the near-miss into a memory his scalp would keep.

He backed down the corridor in measured steps, not running, not panicking, just retreating with the controlled precision of someone who had decided that surviving was more important than looking brave. The nodachi traced defensive arcs between him and the advancing druids, each parry buying a half-second, each redirected lash buying a step.

The third druid joined the pursuit. Its staff discharged a fog that rolled along the floor—thick, organic, smelling like a forest fire in reverse—and Kenji's boots began to stick as the corrupted mist tried to root him where he stood.

"Latch!" Lyra called from behind him.

The corridor behind them sealed. Roots and vines wove into a living barricade with a sound that Kenji would remember—a groan like a tree learning to say *no*, bark and fiber knitting into a wall that wouldn't hold forever but would hold long enough for people who moved fast.

Something struck the barricade from the other side. The living door shuddered.

Held.

Kenji turned and ran.

They burst out of the cave mouth into the Taiga's frost-bitten air. The cold hit Kenji's sweat-soaked skin with the full force of 80% feedback—a temperature differential that registered as a system shock, every pore contracting, every nerve firing a complaint that his brain didn't have time to process.

He hadn't breathed properly in twenty minutes. The first clean lungful burned.

Behind them, the cave mouth sat dark and patient. The hum continued—muffled now, buried under stone, but present. Like a phone ringing in a room you'd locked but couldn't leave.

The voice followed them to the threshold, carried on the last thread of lattice that reached past the cave's lip into open air.

"You'll come back," Sable said, gentle as winter settling over a field it fully intended to kill. "Purifiers always do."

They didn't stop until the frost-line returned and the Taiga's static thinned to its standard broken-signal hiss.

Kenji sat the Citadel man against a pine trunk and checked his own damage. His arms ached from deflecting blighted force. The calf wound from the root-lash was bleeding through bark plate—slow, steady, manageable but not ignorable. His Mark still throbbed, the pulse gradually decelerating as they put distance between themselves and the source.

[Status: Minor Lacerations — Calf, Left]

[Status: Fatigue — Moderate]

[Status: CLAIMANT MARK — Active (Attenuation: Slow)]

He looked back at the black mouth of the cave and rolled his sore shoulder—the same shoulder the wargkin had opened on their first day. Rebuilt, re-scarred, re-informed. The scar tissue had its own opinion about load-bearing, and the opinion was unfavorable.

"We're not strong enough," he said.

Not frustration. Not despair. Assessment. The clean, honest arithmetic of a man who'd learned to separate what he wanted from what was true.

`Inside that cave: a player running a corruption network like an operating system, at least five remaining raised druids operating as remotely controlled combat units, environmental defenses that consumed two fully geared players without visible effort, and a control radius that extends to every surface, every root, every particle of air. Total combat effectiveness of our opposition: overwhelming. Total combat effectiveness of our team: one swordsman with a leaf blade and one Purifier whose strongest abilities are still in beta. The gap isn't a gap. It's a canyon.`

The Citadel man had curled against the pine, eyes closed, face slack with the relief of someone who hadn't expected to see the sky again. He was already asleep—not rest, but the body's emergency shutdown when the adrenaline budget finally hits zero.

Lyra stood at the frost-line, facing the cave. Her back was straight. Her hands were still. The amber in her eyes hadn't faded—it had settled, banked low, like embers deciding whether to cool or catch.

Her voice carried no heat and no doubt.

"Then we will be."
