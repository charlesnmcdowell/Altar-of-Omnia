# Altar of Omnia — The Unbound Path

## Synopsis

In the year 2050, the world is a masterpiece of "Managed Comfort," where ownership is a myth and life is a series of subscriptions. The only escape is **Altar of Omnia**, a neural-link game where time is currency and death is permanent for the "Unbound."

Kenji and Lyra, two "Attendants" tired of the corporate grind, gamble everything on a wild spawn in the lethal Whispering Taiga. Rejecting the safety of the Iron Citadel, they must rely on raw skill, high pain sensitivity, and intuition to survive a world that wants them dead. With no gear, no safety net, and one mistake away from losing their avatars forever, they seek the legendary Druid Grove—the only place where they can truly own their destiny.
