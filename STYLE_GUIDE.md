# Altar of Omnia — Style Guide

## POV, Tense, Voice
- POV: Tight third person, limited to Kenji or Lyra within a scene. No head-hopping.
- Tense: Past tense throughout.
- Register: Cinematic, lean, specific. Let sensation and choice carry theme; keep exposition in-scene and earned.
- Humor: Kenji’s dry quips as pressure relief; pull back during maximum peril. Lyra’s wit is precise and sparing.

## UI Blocks (System Output)
- Brackets: Use square brackets around system lines; one item per line.
- Casing:
  - Headings/labels: Title Case (e.g., "Skill Learned", "Quest Update").
  - Status/flags: SCREAM_SNAKE or PascalCase used consistently within a block (choose the established form for the series; current mix preserved for continuity).
- Formatting:
  - Effects and restrictions get their own lines.
  - Numeric formatting: use "+12%" and "(5s)"; arrows for changes (e.g., "↓ 94%").
  - Cooldowns or timers: "(60s CD)" or explicit line "Cooldown: 60s".
- Examples:
  - [Skill Learned: Rootline Riposte]
  - [Effect: After successful parry …]
  - [Restriction: Requires Purified soil or Grove domain]

## Dialogue & Beats
- Quotation: standard double quotes. Inline thoughts may use backticks or italics; prefer backticks for clarity in code-adjacent scenes.
- Dialogue tags: "said"/"asked"; use action beats to avoid tag clutter.
- Interjections: Use em dashes for interruptions and cutoffs; ellipses for trailing thought only.

## Swear / Content Policy
- Modern swears allowed sparingly; match character voice and intensity. No slurs. Sexual tension: show via micro-actions and choices; keep anatomical repetition minimal.

## Action Clarity
- Name intent + result per beat. Anchor orientation (guard, vector, seam) before flourish. Keep cause→effect visible.
- Pain @80%: use 1–2 highly specific sensations per action (e.g., "tuning fork to bone").

## Recurring Motifs (approved)
- Consent vs. reformatting.
- Systems reading intent (skills verify character).
- Grove as stewardship; Blight as compiler.
- Sensory leitmotifs: tuning-fork hum, copper–ozone tang, light behind wrong glass.

## Formatting
- Chapter titles: "Chapter N: Subtitle".
- Section breaks: blank line; avoid ornamental glyphs.
- UI blocks separated by blank lines from prose when used as scene punctuation.
