# World Lore: The Year 2050

## The State of the World
The world is a masterpiece of "Managed Comfort." Productivity is at an all-time high. For the average person like Kenji and Lyra, life is a high-tech treadmill of high-end subscriptions.
*   **Ownership is Dead:** You don't own your car; you subscribe to a $400-a-month self-driving SUV experience. You don't own your home; you lease a modular apartment. You don't even own your entertainment; you license the right to view it.
*   **The Economy:** 80% of the world's wealth is held by the "Owners"—the titan families who control the robots and AI that run the infrastructure. The other 20% belongs to the "Attendants"—the service class paid to provide the "human touch" that the wealthy still crave.
*   **The Escape:** The only place left to truly own anything is the *Altar of Omnia*.

## The Core Lore of Altar of Omnia

### 1. The 24:1 Time Dilation
The game runs on a neural-link system that compresses time. For every **1 hour** spent in a neural pod in the real world, **24 hours** pass inside the game. This has created a new form of "Time Wealth." A person working a 30-hour week in Chattanooga can live a full second life—growing, training, and exploring—in the "extra" weeks the game provides.

### 2. The Lethality Engine
Unlike traditional RPGs, Omnia doesn't use "Health Points." It uses a physics-based **Lethality Engine**. A sword through the heart is an instant kill, regardless of your level. This makes combat terrifyingly realistic. Players must rely on manual skills, reflexes, and intuition rather than just clicking buttons.

### 3. The "Unbound" vs. The "Settled"
*   **The Settled:** Most players start in Corporate Cities like the Iron Citadel. They pay a subscription fee to "Bind" their soul to a city graveyard. If they die, they respawn at the cost of credits and gear.
*   **The Unbound:** Players who spawn in the wild are "Unbound." They have no safety net. If an Unbound player dies, their avatar is permanently deleted. They lose their progress, their items, and their initial investment.

### 4. The Skill Creation System
Omnia doesn't give you a skill tree; you have to earn it. If a player demonstrates "Significant Manual Discipline"—like Kenji using real-world Kendo forms—the system recognizes the pattern and "codifies" it into a skill. This allows for a "Zero-to-Hero" progression where real-world knowledge is the ultimate cheat code.

## The Regions & Factions

| Region | Description | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Iron Citadel** | The corporate-owned starting zone. Safe, crowded, and expensive. Everything is a micro-transaction. | Low |
| **The Whispering Taiga** | A vast, lethal forest of ancient trees and predators. It is home to hidden Druid logic-gates. | Extreme |
| **The Druid Grove** | A legendary "Non-Settlement" sanctuary. It is rumored to offer the only way to "Bind" your soul without paying a corporate tax. | Unknown |
| **The Blight** | A corruption of the game's code that manifests as rotting, 1-hit-kill monsters like the Blight-Guardian. | Fatal |

## The Current Stakes
Kenji and Lyra have gambled a full day's salary ($190) on a "Wild Spawn" coordinate. They have rejected the corporate safety of the Iron Citadel to hunt for the Druid Grove.

They are currently **Unbound**, lost in the Taiga, and one mistake away from losing everything. Kenji is banking on his **80% Pain Sensitivity** to give him the reflexes of a pro, while Lyra is relying on her **Insurance Underwriter intuition** to navigate the lethal risks of the forest.
