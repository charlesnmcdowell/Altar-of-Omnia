# Altar of Omnia — The Unbound Path

## Roadmap

**Chapter 1: The Bio-Paperweight and the $190 Suicide Note**
*   **The Setting:** Back in their shared apartment after a standard 30-hour work week. The glow of the pods is the only light as they finalize their spawn coordinates.
*   **The Debate:** Kenji pushes for the Iron Citadel to secure starter quests and basic steel. Lyra is adamant about the Whispering Taiga. She argues that by the time they walk from a city to the woods, the corporate "whales" will have already bought up the Druid territory. They agree to risk the Unbound spawn to get ahead of the curve.
*   **The Sync:** As they settle into the gel-beds, Kenji manually overrides the safety protocols, locking his Pain Sensitivity to 80%. He doesn't tell Lyra; he just wants the edge that raw feedback provides.
*   **The Transition:** The hum of Chattanooga fades into the violent, freezing wind of a forest that doesn't want them there.

**Chapter 2: Iron-Oak and Iron Will**
*   **The Landing:** The Whispering Taiga is a sensory overload. The smell of rot and damp pine is cloying, and every shadow feels like a predator. They are hyper-aware that without a Bind-Point, one mistake means their avatars are gone.
*   **The Crafting:** Rejecting the "Item Subscriptions" found in cities, Kenji harvests a fallen Iron-Oak branch. He uses a sharp stone to shave it into a Bokken. It’s heavy, balanced, and—for now—their only hope.
*   **The Lethality Event:** A Giant Weaving-Spider drops from the canopy. Kenji’s high-pain reflexes allow him to track the micro-vibrations in the air, parrying the chitinous legs.
*   **The Chaos:** Lyra, having no spells, resorts to desperation tactics—hurling heavy rocks to distract the beast. Kenji takes a poisoned graze to the ribs to keep the spider's fangs away from her.

**Chapter 3: The Huddle and the Breakthrough**
*   **The Shelter:** They retreat to a hollowed-out tree for an 8-hour in-game night. The darkness is absolute and lethal.
*   **Skill Development:** They spend these hours in frantic practice.
    *   **Kenji:** The system recognizes his real-world Kendo forms. He is awarded [Flowing Strike] and [Kinetic Deflection], turning his wooden stick into a precision weapon.
    *   **Lyra:** In the panic of Kenji’s fever, she experiments with "Focusing" on the moss and roots. She manifests a rudimentary [Vital Sap] heal and a stinging [Nettle Lash].
*   **The Cost:** Despite the new skills, they remain "glass cannons"—no armor, no safety net.

**Chapter 4: The Shadow of the Whale**
*   **The Observation:** While moving through the brush, they spot another player. He is a "Whale"—covered in shimmering Enchanted Plate and wielding a glowing blade. He looks like a god compared to their rags and wood.
*   **The Combat:** They hide and watch as the Whale fights a Forest Behemoth. His gear is superior, but he moves sluggishly, relying on system-assists. He kills the beast but fails to see the "Logic" of the woods, eventually wandering deeper into the thicket, unable to find the trail.
*   **The Discovery:** Lyra spots a squirrel with strangely intelligent eyes. Instead of ignoring it, she uses her intuition to attempt [Animal Speech]. The "squirrel" is a Druid scout in form; it leads them toward a hidden trail the armored player missed.

**Chapter 5: The Trial of the Blight-Guardian**
*   **The Trap:** They witness a lethal environmental trap trigger nearby. A different player—one they don't recognize—is caught by shifting "Glass-Vines." Because of the low-pain settings and lack of awareness, the player is shredded and vanishes instantly. They don't know if he was "deleted," but the message is clear: this is the end of the line.
*   **The Boss:** They face the Blight-Guardian at the Grove’s entrance.
*   **The Synergy:** Kenji uses his 80% sensitivity to parry 1-hit-kill rot-spells, while Lyra uses her new nature spells to root the Guardian in place.
*   **The Bind:** They defeat the beast and are led to the Great Heart-Tree. The notification: [STATUS: BOUND].
*   **The Logout:** The 8-hour pod timer ends. They wake up back in the apartment, exhausted but finally "Owners" of their own progress.

## Characters

*   **Kenji:** Uses Kendo skills, high pain sensitivity (80%) for reflex edge. Wields an Iron-Oak Bokken. Skills: [Flowing Strike], [Kinetic Deflection].
*   **Lyra:** Intuitive, prefers nature/Druid path. Skills: [Vital Sap], [Nettle Lash], [Animal Speech].

## System Recap

*   **Focus:** Manual skill and intuition over gear and subscriptions.
*   **The Stakes:** Permadeath vs. Finding a Soul-Anchor.
*   **Growth:** Real-world Kendo and Life-Risk intuition translating into "System-Recognized" skills.
